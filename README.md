# Metro-Madness
 Metro Madness is a game design project. The scripting is not as good as my recent projects (as it was one of my firsts Unity projects), but it is focused on the game design and finding a good ludonarrative harmony between the mechanics of the game and the message you want to share throught them.

In Metro Madness, Nyeste (your character) needs to reach to the job office because he has an important meeting and lives differents situations in the way on it. These situations are decisions in which you have to decide if you want to help the people involved in them (and losing time to reach to the job office) or not helping them or even creating a worse scenario for them to don't lose more time (and starting to regret about it). If your character lose too much time, it won't reach the office in time, and if it has so much regrets about all the situations he lived, he won't be focused on the meeting and he will lose his job. So, you need to find a balance to reach the job in time and with clear conscience.

The message of this game focus on the fact that we are living in a society that wants everything happening fast and with inmediate results, and the problem with everything going so fast is that we have little time to do something that is really important and that could create a better world: *thinking*. The negative final scenarios are Nyeste's biggest fear: losing his job, and that makes him take really quick and sometimes bad decisions in the way to his office. As Nyeste, there are a lot of people that makes their decisions feeling anxious and not really thinking about what they really want to do, and you can see it with the only positive final scenario: Nyeste keeps his job. But, even he was successful in the meeting, is he really happy about what happened that day? If you replay the game, you won't find more than these scenarios, there is no alternative final scenario where he realizes that he is maybe living in a loop where all his decisions are conditioned by only one feeling: fear. That is what the game tries to say, if you are living that fast, without even thinking how are you feeling and what you really want, you will never realize that you need to change the way you live to feel better.
